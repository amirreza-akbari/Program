# Fibonacci Sequence Calculator in C#

This is a simple yet powerful Fibonacci sequence calculator written in C#. The program allows you to input the number of terms you want to generate from the Fibonacci sequence, and it will calculate and display the sequence up to that number.

## üöÄ Features

- Calculates Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
- Fast and efficient implementation.
- Simple user interface with console output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fibonacci-csharp.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd fibonacci-csharp
```

### 3. Open the project in your preferred C# editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

### 4. Build and run the project:
- In Visual Studio, press `F5` to build and run the project.

## üéÆ Usage

After running the program, follow these steps:

1. Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want to generate.
2. The program will display the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.

### Example:

If you enter `10`, the output will look like this:
```
Fibonacci Sequence (First 10 terms):
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

This program uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. The calculation follows the recurrence relation:
```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```
Where `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.
